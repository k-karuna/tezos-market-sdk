The Tezos Market SDK invites developers to discover the future of Web3 gaming with a complete kit that empowers game
developers with the ability to:

- Connect to a Tezos wallet
- Utilize data on the blockchain
- Call smart contracts
- True ownership of in-game assets

The Tezos SDK supports Desktop, Android, iOS, and browsers. Beyond allowing game developers to interact with the Tezos
blockchain, this SDK is a helpful resource for developing any Tezos decentralized application (dApp).
